# Using gorm as an orm library in Golang ðŸ‘‹

In this repository, we go through using orm library like gorm to handle crud operation in the database

To start this application please use first `go mod tidy` and then use `go run .` to run.

We must use `go run .` because if you use just `go run main.go`

The code getting the error because of using struct in another file in the same package

and when we use `go run main.go` other files like model.go are ignored and you must consider another

the file is important to you and to use model.go you can use the command below:

`go run main.go model.go`

If you have multiple files this way is not good for you

and I suggest you using `go run .` to contain all go files needed to run when you start the go application

I hope this code is useful for you

if you have any questions please contact me
